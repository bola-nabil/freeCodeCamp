# ðŸ“š freeCodeCamp Projects & Challenges

As I progressed through the **freeCodeCamp curriculum**, I built multiple front-end and full-stack projects to apply the concepts I learned. These include responsive layouts, interactive components, React state management, APIs, and more. This repo is a showcase of those builds, reflecting my growth and skills.
