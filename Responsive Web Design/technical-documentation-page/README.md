## 📖 Description

The **Technical Documentation Page** is a multi-section documentation layout with a sidebar navigation menu. It allows readers to click on a link in the sidebar to scroll to the relevant section (“getting started”, “usage”, “API reference”, etc.). The design focuses on readability, structure, and responsiveness across devices.
